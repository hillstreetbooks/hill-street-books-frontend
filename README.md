## About the project

Hill Street Books is an interactive bookstore for self-published children’s books authors. Hill Street Books is trying to bridge the gap between the user and the authors. Many bookstores only publish small information about the author and their book. Hill Street Books allows for interacting with content on the author page of the bookstore along with purchasing the specific book. Some of the content on the page is videos, coloring pages, contest, and different featured characters. Authors will be able to generate more profit by managing transactions themselves and marketing their own books. Children interacting with the page will keep wanting to come back and feel like the authors books are always coming back to life.

### PR Guidelines

1. There are two types of PR - draft and ready for review. We use Draft PRs to get early feedback from peers when the implementation path is unclear.
2. Always assign everyone as the reviewers for the PR.
3. Ideally, we want 2 reviews before we move the ticket to QA/ Testing.

### Branching Guidelines

1. Create one branch for every new ticket that you start working on.
2. All the features must be branched off `develop`.
3. Branch names start with the ticket code, followed by the title of the ticket.

### Commit Guidelines

1. Each commit message should start with the ticket code, followed by your commit message. Eg.
   ```sh
   git commit -m "[HSB-1] Initial Project commit"
